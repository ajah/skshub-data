# "Something" Nonprofit Sector Data - Entities and Activities

- **Entities:** This CSV contains information about individual organizations in the nonprofit sector. The data includes all organizations that are registered with the CRA as a Public Foundation, Private Foundation or Charitable Organization.
- **Activities:** This CSV contains grant data from the federal Grants & Contributions database. This data allows us to understand more about the activities and programs carried out by organizations in the nonprofit sector

## Overview

Ajah is exploring building common, open source infrastructure for the information already available about the sector, focusing on existing open data sources about nonprofit organizations, grants, and evaluations. Through this work, Ajah is looking to make this information more accessible to the whole sector.

These CSVs will become the building blocks of a data infratsructure prototype for the nonprofit sector. We hope the prototype will show the benefits of open, sharable and organized data, as well as allow different stakeholders to better understand the organizations that make up our sector and the activities and programs they run.

The data we are currently using comes from the federal government, and thus only allows us to have access to the grants given by the government. The prototype is meant to showcase how data infratsructure can help facilitate research for the sector. We hope that the sucess of the prototype will convince private foundations to share their data in order to gain a better picture of the philanthropic landscape in Canada.

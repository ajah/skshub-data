**This project:** Ajah wants to explore what shared infrastructure could look like for the nonprofit sector. We are looking to build a common, open-source infrastructure for the information already available about the sector, focusing on existing open data sources about nonprofit organizations, grants, and evaluations. Our goal is to make this information more accessible and usable to anyone in the sector.

The CSVs found here will become the building blocks of a data infrastructure prototype for the nonprofit sector. We hope the prototype will show the benefits of open, sharable and organized data and allow different stakeholders to better understand the organizations that make up our sector and the activities and programs they run.

The data we are currently using comes from the federal government, and thus only allows us to have access to the grants given by the government. The prototype is meant to showcase how data infrastructure can help facilitate research for the sector. We hope that the success of the prototype will convince private foundations to share their data to gain a better picture of the philanthropic landscape in Canada.

- **Entities:** This CSV contains information about individual organizations in the nonprofit sector. The data includes all organizations that are registered with the CRA as a Public Foundation, Private Foundation or Charitable Organization.
- **Activities:** This CSV contains grant data from the federal Grants & Contributions database. This data allows us to understand more about the activities and programs carried out by organizations in the nonprofit sector.
- **Linkages:** This CSV contains the corpus text of those organizations that had a listed website URL. The text was scrapped directly from the organization's website. As we further develop the database, we hope to include other links connected to the organizations such as social media handles and links.
